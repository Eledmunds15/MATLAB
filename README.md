# MATLAB

This repository contains code in MATLAB language from my Aerospace Design, Test, Build module of my Aerospace Engineering degree. The code answers questions on MathWorks Grader; an online platform used to improve skills in programming with MATLAB.

List of problems

Create_ellipse: Plots an ellipse using the semi-major axis length (a), semi-minor axis length (b) and number of points in each half of ellipse (N).

NorthropGrummanF14: A script that calculates the Aspect Ratio and Mean Chord for the Northrop Grumman F14 at different sweep angles and plots them.

ISACalculations: We are given a data sheet "P_and_T_sheffield.csv" and are expected to calculate the Pressure and Temperature for 8 days during each hour. Afterwards, using this data, the Barometric formula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometric_formula#:~:text=The%20barometric%20formula%2C%20sometimes%20called,1000%20meters%20above%20sea%20level) can be used to calculate the Pressure at different altitudes. We calculated the pressure at 2000m and plotted all 3 matrices on different graphs.
